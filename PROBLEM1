/* An Internet service provider has 3 different subscription packages for its customers: 

Package A: For P995/mo 10 hrs of access are provided. Additional hours are P20/hr.
Package B: For P1495/mo 20 hrs of access are provided. Additional hours are P10/hr. 
Package C: For P1995/mo of unlimited access is provided. 

Write a program that calculates a customerâ€™s monthly bill. 
It should ask which package the customer has purchased and how many hours were used. 
It should then display the total amount due. */
