/* Write a program that computes a customer’s water bill. 
The bill includes a Php 35 water demand charge plus a consumption (use) charge of Php 1.10 for every gallon used. 
Consumption is figured from meter readings in gallons taken recently and during the previous month. 
If the customer’s unpaid balance is greater than 0, a P20 late charge is assessed as well. */
