/* Create a program that will generate the sum of all whole numbers starting from 1 up to a given number.  
For example, given an input of 5, the summation is 1+2+3+4+5 = 15.  
Continue asking for input and calculating until the user enters 0 or a negative number.  
See the sample outputs below: 

Enter a number: 6 
The sum of all whole numbers from 1 to 6 is 21. 

Enter a number: 8 
The sum of all whole numbers from 1 to 8 is 36. 

Enter a number: 5 
The sum of all whole numbers from 1 to 5 is 15. 

Enter a number: 12 
The sum of all whole numbers from 1 to 12 is 78. 

Enter a number: 15 
The sum of all whole numbers from 1 to 15 is 120.

Enter a number: 0 
Thank you! */
